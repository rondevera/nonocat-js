Experimental JS utilities for use with GitHub's web UI. The extra arm for the
Octocat.

Features:

- Double-clicking GitHub notifications to mark individual ones as unread,
  because "Mark all as read" isn't always what you want.
- That's it for now. Like I said, experimental.

Tested only in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox; there are a few places where I
know it'll break in IE. Intentionally doesn't use jQuery (yes, GitHub's
already using it) or other libraries because I'm masochistic.
